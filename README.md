# Multitask_Classification_On_Amazon_Reviews
Conducted research and developed a system under Dr Stef Garasto on the comparison of numerous machine learning models to solve a multi-task classification problem using an existing dataset for the Amazon Product Reviews.
Executed the project using modules such as NLTK, Tensorflow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, and evaluated the classification models to predict the ratings of the Amazon Reviews and Product Categories. 
Achievement - Implemented supervised machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Random Forest to conduct this research and achieved an accuracy of 63% using TFIDF Vectorisation.
