# Multitask_Classification_On_Amazon_Reviews
Due to the popularity of online marketplaces in recent decades, online vendors and merchants now require their customers to provide feedback on what they have purchased. As a result, millions of evaluations are written every day, making it difficult for a potential client to decide whether or not to buy a product. For product makers, analysing many such viewpoints is difficult and time-consuming. This paper compares various machine learning algorithms to solve a multi-task classification problem from text data. The author used machine learning mod- els to predict the ratings of the Amazon reviews and whether the product falls in the video games or musical instrument category. The author used supervised machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and Random Forest to conduct this research. The accuracy of the machine learning models was compared to select the best model for the multi-task categorisation issue. Consequently, the SVM technique surpasses all other models in terms of accuracy.
